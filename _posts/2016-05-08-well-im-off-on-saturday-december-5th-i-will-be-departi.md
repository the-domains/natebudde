Well... I'm off. On Saturday, December 5th I will be departing with schoolmates to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The trip is part of a semester-long class with an objective to provide solar powered lighting to rural communities in which electricity is nonexistent. The hope is that this lighting will improve safety and reduce crime in what would otherwise be a completely dark region in the world.

During my three weeks in Africa, I (along with a team of my peers) will be charged with building solar lighting arrays that will illuminate the region. This will be an incredible opportunity to experience what it's like to live in the third world as well as a way to help those less fortunate.

The trip will be capped with a three day stay in Istanbul, Turkey to take in the sights. Should be interesting considering recent political and military escalation, but I am assured by my professor, the UC International Department, and the US State Department that all will go as planned and that I will have an awesome experience.

I plan to chronicle this trip through regular blog posts and will try to keep social media up-to-date as much as possible. If you'd like to keep in touch, I encourage you to download WhatsApp, a free smartphone application that allows international communication without racking up a massive phone bill.

Wish me luck and I will see you in a few weeks!
