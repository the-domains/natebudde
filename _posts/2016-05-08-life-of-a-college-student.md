I made myself dinner today. Several hours of studying (napping) had passed so I thought I'd take a break and let my culinary juices flow.

I'm currently in the business of eating whatever is within arm's reach. There's nothing like cold pizza for breakfast or beer for dinner, but I changed it up today and purchased myself a $3.49 steak at the grocery. The thing came prepackaged in what can only be described as a pudding cup and the sell-by date was marked for today. What could go wrong?

Some notes on production: don't use a single-egg fry pan. Grease likes to spit and catch fire.

After what seemed like a solid hour of uncontrollable flame and smoke generation, my charcoal briquette was finished. My "meal" looked so meager and insignificant it necessitated documentation.

I still have another $3.49 steak in the fridge. I'd leave it outside for some poor animal to pick at, but I'm afraid the damn thing will be there a week later! Blecchhh! Back to Pizza Rolls and Chipotle for this guy. 

One thing I learned: my smoke detectors are garbage. To call my house 'smokey' after I finished cooking would be a crime. I had to use my knife to cut a path to the table and they didn't go off once! I sure hope the house doesn't catch fire tonight... What a shitty last meal that would be.
